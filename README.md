# Texas Hold'em AI ðŸ¤–
CS Independent Study @UVa

Overview
--------
This is an independent study on current application of machine learning techniques into Texas Holdâ€™em AI.

Possible Topic(s)
-----------------
**Topic: Pre-flop Decisions.**

When we play the poker game as human, the pre-flop situation emotionally and strategically determines how we play the whole round of game. As the beginning stage of the machine prediction, more accurate and simplified calculation at this stage might be helpful to foresee or narrow the result of the entire game.

Rules require different strategy:

- No-limit Holdâ€™em
- Limit Hold'em / Cash game

Three important stages to consider:

- When cards are dealed
	- David Sklanskyâ€™s table
	- Expected Hand Strength (EHS)
- When itâ€™s your turn to bet
	- Limp / Raise / Fold decision
	- Stake/blind ratio and Jam/Fold strategy
- When everyone finishes his/her actions
	- Possible range of everyoneâ€™s hand

Milestones
---------
1. Learn different machine learning techniques and decide the specify aspect our research project will focus on. 

2. Look for the proper dataset to train the netrual network and compare the results of different training methodology.

3. Integrate the project API into current AI bot and finish the research paper

Datasets
--------
- Standardization
	- pot size
	- player level
- Remove possible error
	- unreasonable plays
- Additional information
	- player waiting time
	- ...
