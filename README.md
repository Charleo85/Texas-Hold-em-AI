# Texas-Hold-em-AI
CS Independent Study @UVa

Overview
--------
This is an independent study on current application of machine learning techniques into Texas Hold’em AI.

Possible Topic(s)
-----------------
**Topic: Pre-flop Decisions.**
- No-limit Hold’em
- Limit Hold'em / Cash game

Three important stages to consider:
- When cards are dealed
	- David Sklansky’s table
	- Expected Hand Strength (EHS)
- When it’s your turn to bet
	- Limp / Raise / Fold decision
	- Stake/blind ratio and Jam/Fold strategy
- When everyone finishes his/her actions
	- Possible range of everyone’s hand

Milestone
---------
1. Learn different machine learning techniques and decide the specify aspect our research project will focus on. 

2. Look for the proper dataset to train the netrual network and compare the results of different training methodology.

3. Integrate the project API into current AI bot and finish the research paper

Datasets
--------
- Standardize
	- pot size
	- player level
- Remove possible error
	- unreasonable plays
- Additional information
	- player waiting time
	- ...
